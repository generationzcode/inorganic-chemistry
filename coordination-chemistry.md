* What are primary valencies?

* What are ligands?
* Name some bidendate ligands
* What are ambidendate ligands?
* What is backbonding? What causes it?
* When does Sidgwick's EAN rule fail to work?
* How is EAN affected by pi electrons donated by ligands? (I don't know this one)
* Draw the t2g orbitals and the Eg orbitals
* How many t2g orbitals are there? How many Eg orbitals are there?
* Why isnt the valence bond theory fully accepted? (perhaps the better question is why it's still being taught...)
* Which complexes are more unstable -> inner or outer oribital complexes?
* Which d orbitals have their energies increased due to octahedral complexes being formed and why?
* How is the size of the energy gap between the T2g and EG orbitals determined? Why does this method work? (spectroscopic method)
